Python project for Einf√ºhrung Data Science.
The aim of the project is to visually display the data set at hand and to perform the necessary tests for analysis. 
Some libraries might be needed to install. I have provided the needed terminal prompts.
pip install matplotlib   
pip install openpyxl
pip install pandas
pip install seaborn
pip install scipy
